------------------------------------------

>In the digital age, people tend to have multiple credentials on multiple platforms and to automate the process there are centralized password managers available. But with the power of `immutability` of blockchain and `decentralization`, we provide a `trustless` service to handle your credentials.

------------------------------------------
### Features

- `Trustless service` as there is no 3rd party agent involved.
- `Safe` as all the credentials are encrypted using symmetric encryption.
- `Reliable` as all the data is stored in a decentralized way using IPFS.
- `Accessible` as there is not seperate platform but a chrome extension to use the service.
- `Efficient` considering the scalability factor, data gets stored off chain without compromising security.
- `Practical` fits into the existing system directly without need of any modification.
